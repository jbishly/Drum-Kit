//Canvas is added in HTML5, the HTML <canvas> element can be used to draw graphics via scripting in JavaScript. It's also used by WebGL to draw hardware-accelerated 3D.	
//grab the canvas first

const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d'); //resize our canvas before we do any of our drawings - by default set in body
canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
canvas.height = window.innerHeight;
//ctx.strokeStyle: specifies the color or style to use for the lines around shapes. The default is #000 (black).
ctx.strokeStyle ='#BADA55'; 
//ctx.lineJoin: determines how two connecting segments (of lines, arcs or curves) with non-zero lengths in a shape are joined together), bevel | round | miter.
ctx.lineJoin = 'round';
//ctx.lineCap: the shape of the stroke, round | butt | square.
ctx.lineCap ='round';
//ctx.lineWidth: sets the thickness of lines in space units.
